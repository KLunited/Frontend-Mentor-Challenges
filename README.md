## My process
  I started by writing HTML. Once I am happy with the HTML I then turned my attention to CSS. But my process of writing CSS was a bit all over the place. I just started with the element I thought I knew how to style and ran with it. During the development process I asked ChatGPT quite a few questions when I really couldn't figure out a way.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned a lot from this challenge. 

The first thing I learned is that I will need more practice with CSS. I am familiar with the HTML required in this challenge, but when it comes to defining classes for an element, I had no plan of thinking how they would be used in writing CSS styles later. Luckily this is a small project, which means I did not have to worry about reusing styles. 

The first thing I practised was that embedding a Google font. I forgot the process as I only took the Web Development course on Udemy but have had little practice. I only knew about Frontend Mentor after consulting ChatGPT.

The second thing I learned was the difference between the different values I can define size attributes such as width and height. I was using 'em' and 'rem' in my initial CSS styles without knowing what they really do. As I was previewing the project and changing my CSS, I tried all measurements and units hoping I would land on the right one. In the end, I had to ask ChatGPT to tell me the difference.

The third thing I learned is how to make the image responsive to its container element. In my initial CSS, I was trying to fit the <div> container to its content. Then when I tested the responsiveness, it did not come out as intended. After a long struggle, I had to consult ChatGPT again. I employed what it showed me in my current CSS. However, I still do not know whether my end result meets the challenge set.

The fourth thing I learned was creating a repository on Github, creating a file structure on Github and hosting my site on Github Pages and Netlify. It has to be said that I first tried to host the site on Github Pages. However, after publishing the site, the QR Code image was not being displayed. Even after changing the file path in every way I know and asking ChatGPT, the QR Code image was still not being displayed. I had to ask one of my friend who is a web developer for help. He quickly identified there was an issue deploying the image and suggested I host the site on Netlify instead. And it worked. I still don't know what went wrong when hosting the site on Github Pages, and hope that someone can figure out the issue.



### Continued development

Now that I know my weakness lies in lack of practice with CSS, especially concerning responsiveness and positioning, I will need to practice more in those areas. I will also need to practice more with different size values as I was spending a lot of time trying to make everything the right size. Lastly, I am quite new to Github and other platforms such as Netlify, as I complete more challenges and build more sites, I will need to familarise with their UI and functions.

I need to give special thanks to my mate Stephen Man who helped me solve the publishing issue. I managed to solve the issue hosting on Github Pages in the end. But still a big thanks to my mate for making the time available.
